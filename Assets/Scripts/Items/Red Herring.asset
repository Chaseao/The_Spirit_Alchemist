  itemDescription: "Red Herring\r\n\r-------------\nOnce rumored to hold the key
    to immortality and infinite wisdom, the petals of the Red Herring were heavily
    sought after for centuries. Now, with the knowledge that the Red Herring does
    absolutely nothing and has absolutely no flavor, it has become nothing more than
    an uncommon landscaping choice.\r\n\r\nUsed in: gardens, garnish, food coloring\r\n"
