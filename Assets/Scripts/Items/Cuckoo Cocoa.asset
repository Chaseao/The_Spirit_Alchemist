  itemDescription: "Cuckoo Cocoa\r\n\r\nA popular choice among students the night
    before an exam. The energy boost from a single cup of Cuckoo Coffee is enough
    to blast through an entire thesis paper, an autobiography, and possibly a new
    religious doctrine all in one night. The quality of said works may be questionable,
    but at least they were written quickly.\r\n\r\nUsed in: insanely potent coffee,
    chocolate, matchmaking potions\r"
  recipe: []
